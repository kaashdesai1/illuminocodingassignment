a. Two ways to test the solution 
-Go to directory in which the URL_TEST folder is located 
-run python3 test.py or url_checker.py on command line 
-test.py checks all urls listed in urls.txt file to see if invalid or valid
-url_checker.py allows the user to have three options 
    -1.Enter a new URL
    2.Use previous URL
    3.Exit
 this stores the new URL to the url.txt file
-you can also run this on a compiler like pycharm or spyder 

b. This solution is an object oriented solution. The code is broken down in multiple functions. It is modular as there is a function for everything.
Since, it is object oriented, the design is simplistic and it makes the code more easier to read and understand. Everything is broken down
simpiler.

c. If I had more time I would have just created one function for the solution. This would have been simpiler for testing purposes and faster. It would
be more complex to code because of all the elements that are needed for the solution. Breaking it down in multiple functions is more organized in my opinion.

d. Let me know if you have any questions when running the code.
